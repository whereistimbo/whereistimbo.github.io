<p>Stopping the diaphragm is extremely important because your egoic thoughts (or life situation) is tied to the diaphragm. The ego needs time to exist – a past or a future. You are consciousness and exist only in the present moment. I have not read this in a book or been told this by anyone, I have experienced this. I don’t understand all of it yet but I know my thought patterns have completely changed since activating my kundalini – time no longer exists in my thoughts. The only thing that matters to me is this present moment.</p>

<p>I later figured out that his kechari had not advanced far enough and so he couldn’t seal the back of his throat. This is extremely important. When a baby is first born, the doctor turns the baby over and pats it on the back. This pushes the embryonic fluid out of the lungs and stimulates the nerves at the roof of the mouth that signal the body to breathe. If your kechari does not block these nerves from the air coming out of your diaphragm, you will not be able to go breathless.</p>

<p>It is a vey quiet peaceful state of being. It is a beginning stage of another reality, I know this intuitively. I also know that the awareness of this being writing calling itself I is not sufficiently developed even as the incorrect cells making up the eyes of a blind person cannot perceive light though standing in it on a sunny day. It is like this. It is like being in a womb It is like gestating waiting to be born.</p>

<p>My issues all stem from Achieving Kechari. Prior to it I did not have these things happening while not practicing Kriya Yoga.</p>

<p>So I believe what is going on is an accelerated change in the finer bodies and this is in turn is likely laying down some new neural pathways or activating ones heretofore unused in this meat suit.</p>

<p>Sounds great and exotic does it not? Yes lets refine our nervous system how lovely right? I guess but to me it reminds me of when I was extremely young and the body was not as cooperative with my desires as it should have been.</p>

<p>This is sort of like having become very accustomed to being in an adult body and now I am like a young child again trying to get his legs working right to walk which I do remember very clearly and did not like at all.</p>

<p>So yes I am being more attentive to this new frequency things are operating on learning how to operate in it. This is nothing special just new and unaccustomed to.</p>

<p>One thing is very much certain I am really getting direct knowledge of not being this body but being in it. Not being this nervous system and brain but the very thing working through it and not even being this thing typing calling itself I.</p>

<p> The reason we breathe is because the outgoing breath stimulates the nerves on the roof of our mouth. Sealing off the back of the throat with your tongue is far easier than slowing down the breath by not moving and trying to still the mind. Then we have to contend with what feels like cilia type tissue that moves back and forth like falling dominoes in our diaphragm stimulating us to breathe. The stronger the muscle of the diaphragm, or the better in shape it is, the quicker the cilia tissue will stop vibrating when you stretch it back and forth from Uddiyana Bandha to an upright pose. </p>

<p> Another aspect that I think contributed to my awakening is that I haven't blown my load in over two months. In all seriousness, I think there is a connection. I have read that sperm has the same make up of bindu, so it drains your life energy when it is expended or something like that. I have a thought (misplaced???) that the newly created sperm are going to need some energy to fulfill their mission so they help themselves to the prana that is suppose to be rising up and opening up your chakras. Or maybe the sperm is created out of the prana itself depleting it for hours or days what should be going up your sushumna. Yogananda says that sexuality is the greatest impediment to a males spiritual progress.</p>

<p> The tantric technique of separating orgasm from ejaculation is just Vajroli mudra and Uddiyana bandha. I've learned that the Uddiyana part is more important than the Vajroli. When you pass the point of no return, you employ Vajroli mudra and exhale slowly into Uddiyana and then exhale again and then exhale again (for a total of 3 times) and finally stretch like a cat taking the energy up the spine. I still have small mistakes but I'm not ready to give up that part of my life yet. Until you master the technique it is good to press into the perineum with your thumb and fingers as a backup. I don't think I've had a full ejaculation in 4 months. I feel an incredible amount of current in missionary position with lips or tongues engaged and also hip to hip contact feels likes sparks going off. Many times during the act I get dizzy with bliss and have had to stop and rest for awhile. I also enjoy sex so much more because you stop focusing on the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and instead just focus on being with another divine spirit. I don't know for sure but I think sex has actually aided in my awakening.</p>

<p> This came from understanding when I was meditating . People throw the word samadhi around . I have read the Dhammapada and so know that the Buddha talked about 8 levels of samadhi. I don't know what each one entails. I remember reading the Buddha say that when you slow the mind down enough you can actually see and feel your thoughts coming at you like waves.</p>

<p> Sri Yukteswar (Yogananda's guru) said you gain far more knowledge and understanding from meditation than you will ever learn from a book. I remember one night reading Sri Ramakrishna saying that you don't have the capability nor the capacity to understand what you are with your mind or your limited senses. And so you must transcend the mind to have this understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> when I first started going breathless I could feel different levels of intensity in my meditations. When there was still the turmoil of movement floating around in my diaphragm, there was still thought. It was far less than in the ordinary state of breathing but I could tell that the goal was to stop all movement which definitely would require a complete seal of the nasal passage. Then I could achieve a state of mind in a few minutes that would take hours within the limits of my present capabilities.</p>

<p> Even if I stopped breathing and remained motionless for 8 hours, microscopically there was still going to be movement in the diaphragm coming from the open nasal passage. If you could seal off all of the openings to the body and get an air tight seal, you could apply pressure internally into the system and slow everything down in possibly minutes as to opposed to 8 hours or who knows how long it would take. This would require a tongue long enough to seal off the nasal passage.</p>

<p> The thought has come to me that if I completely stop every slightest bit of movement in the diaphragm and the mind is completely shut off, does the circulatory system then become the next thing that you have to shut down? When there is food in the system, the body has work to do and must move. Which again takes us back to kechari because the Amrit that is secreted when the pituitary and pineal glands are stimulated, allows the body to live without food and water ending the necessity to eliminate anything.</p>

<p> Since we can never understand what God is through our limited senses, it makes more sense to spend your time trying to understand the mechanical aspects of the body that allow us to shut down what is limiting our perception, than using this mind to gain an understanding of what samadhi or God is through book knowledge. One liberating thing about where I'm at is the concept of Hell becomes a joke. We're already trapped in a prison. I guess it could be worse if we were put into a vehicle that needed more external things to keep it functioning properly, had less ability to obtain them and had even more senses and mental activity to experience the discord. One would start thinking that God is a sadist and I don't believe that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Thinking process is resident in the brain and not directly connected with diaphragm (which remains a breathing apparatus). Secondly, there is no need to "stop" the thinking process, neither one is advised to do so through laborious efforts. We are talking about 'setting aside'. Here's Patanjali's method as I understand (and practice):</p>

<p> The model: The “thinking instruments” (brain, mānas, and buddhi) are different from the “thinking process”. Electromagnetic vibrations arrive from the environment—re¬ceived as sense impulses which travel throughout the nervous system by means of the spinal cord and enter the brain. These vibrations are transferred to mānas flowing over the memory pools and then to buddhi. The energy of the incoming sense impulses stirs the structure of predispositions and these impulses attract memory patterns from the past-experienced emo-tions. Ideal thinking would be a process wherein the mind acts only as a catalyst, however, the untamed mind brings associated emotions to create vibrant “individualized” thoughts causing mind modifications.</p>

<p> In the construction of thoughts Buddhi brings in the intellectual layer that makes an indi-vidual’s signature on the thoughts, mānas brings in the emotional layer that is judgmental, and the brain brings in a highly physi¬cal/ sexual orientation. Why does the mind indulge? Under the influence of tamas, mind conceals that the incoming impulses are mere appearances. Moreover, such a shallow percep¬tion is further affected by a conditioned cognition—one that uses only known patterns in the memory. Lastly, the emotional gloss creates attachment to the objects, and the mind lets us believe that such colored and deformed perception gives us our “only reality.” Such indulgent mind deserves to be kept aside. Sūtra 2.25/II.54 tells us that pratyāhāra is a process in which one consciously separates the mind from the thinking process and not allow them to engage and interact. This is neither an accident nor a psychic adventure; it happens at will. That is why it’s a breakthrough.</p>

<p> For reaching this milestone the secondary means of Yoga con¬tribute collectively—yama-niyama compliance eliminates causes of alternating mind-states, āsana steadies and stills the physical body to remove any residual agitations, and prāṇāyāma’s regu¬lated breathing does the same to the astral body by eliminating the sentimental swings.</p>

<p> But what happens to mind is even more significant. All along, mind has been actively participating in the thinking process to generate knowledge even if it is conditioned, individualized and sentimental. Through the Yoga practices, mind evolves into its original self, the Universal Mind, and starts sourcing spiritual knowledge. Thus, in a dramatic turnaround, the brain and its part¬ners stop creating defective knowledge and become users of exact knowledge. Mind can return to its original role of a catalyst and not indulge. This is non-attachment.</p>

<p> It is tough to control the sense organs that owe their natural out¬bound tendency to a human legacy of millions of years. Instead of reining in the sense organs, it is easier to snap the link between sensing and thinking.</p>

<p> Pratyāhāra is considered a breakthrough because, in that state, the freedom from longing for all objects eliminates the outward bound orientation of your perception. Instead of repeatedly forc¬ing your attention inward, your perception would come to re¬side there peacefully, at will. Desires are defused, perception is direct and independent of sensing, the sense organs are retired and mind is no more agitated.</p>
<p> Our usual reflex thinking directly connects the sense organs with the organs of action, resulting in an automated behavior / response. With the sense organs withdrawing from attachment to objects, the organs of activity are relieved of their bondage of compulsive habits and are brought under full conscious control. One develops a relaxed indifference toward objects, people, and events that, until then, had held you captive. But it all happens in several progressive phases.</p>

<p> First, there is an involuntary pause, Nirodh pariṇāma, (a state of mind transformation, is the silenc¬ing of the senses) in this sequence:</p>
<p> • The brain reacts to that which is seen (saṃskāra).</p>
<p> • Then follows a moment of restraint (nirodha).</p>
<p> • Then ensues a moment wherein the mind responds to both these factors.</p>
<p> • Both factors momentarily hold each other out and the perceiving consciousness has full sway over that mo¬ment (Sūtra 2.27/III.9).</p>

<p> A complete subjugation of the sense organs neither happens sud¬denly nor is sustained for a long period. At first, the snapping of the link between sensing and thinking happens in a flash, for a fraction of a second. Though this pause leaves a beautiful memo¬ry, it remains an involuntary occurrence. You need to cultivate the ability to interrupt thinking by a willful pause in order to hold on to that.</p>

<p> Then a response leads to a willed pause in this way:</p>
<p> 1. You are concentrating on some object and are slowly be¬coming aware of the act of concentrating itself. To that awareness, the act of concentration becomes an object. This stimulates the mind into thought-forms and results in mind modifications.</p>
<p> 2. But now any modification is immediately followed by a different awareness, a need to control the modifications, and this brings in your will to stop the form creation, and the mind momentarily ceases to modify itself. But this control itself generates mild modifications.</p>
<p> 3. The above “modify and control” sequence goes on for a while, but you persist and eventually manage to be aware of both triggers almost simultaneously.</p>
<p> 4. Then it happens—a willed pause. Both sensing and will¬ing are delicately balanced and consciously suspended. Neither the object nor the controlling creates any mind modification. Your awareness suddenly elevates itself be¬cause there is no medium for perception.</p>

<p> Any effort to control the mind is counterproductive, because the controlling thoughts create mind modifications and increase the mind turbulence. Early attempts at concentration become frustrating, because even with the eyes closed and the body stilled, either the object of meditation (if one has such an object) or the awareness of your act of meditating itself creates mind modifications. The thinking instruments and the thinking process have no agenda of their own. But, once the thinking instruments and the individual thinking process are so equipped, it is easier to apply the will to excite or inhibit the nerves and thus control the thoughts and actions. This ability further facilitates a willed pause that leaves space for the arising of spiritual perception.</p>
<p> Eventually, it is cultivation of habit from what first occurs as a one-of-a-kind involuntary flash. This is a long and often frustrat¬ing process. But despite its momentary nature, the initial vision is alluring enough. The vision is life-changing. The so-called esoteric becomes a viable way of life. The abil¬ity to separate the thinking instrument and the thinking process takes root at long last. When this becomes a habit and mind’s thought-form making tendency is arrested, that eventually re¬sults in a constant ability of meditation (Sūtra 2.29/III.11). The brain is not activated, as they used to even at the slightest sensory provocation, and thus the thought-churning tendency is voided.</p>

<p> The practice: One needs a dual approach.</p>
<p> 1. Watching the thoughts with the thoughts: Only by knowing the thinking process more subtly can we control it. From time to time, we have to bring our thoughts under the microscope. The big advantage is that at that very moment the thought-chain is broken. Then, one should make a note (mental or written) of the thought and trace it backwards. On that pathway, we recognize a lot of branching out or diversions. That’s typical perpetuation of thoughts. Then, we should pick up 3 to 5 such diversions and trace what caused it. It would invariably something emotional, and something in deep memory. At this moment, one would always find an opportunity to space thoughts and eventually widen it further into a pause. Care should be taken in not pressing any harder as that itself causes more thoughts. As well as remember to apply slight efforts of will to suspend thoughts.</p>

<p> 2. Raising an antenna to the Universal Mind: Through a well-directed practice, one should activate bindu and sahasrara chakra. These chakras, when supplied energy, tend to derive intelligence from the Universal mind and provide it to the thinking apparatus. This reverses the flow – the brain becomes a custodian of unconditioned knowledge, rather than the manufacturer of faulty experienced-based knowledge. This makes the thinking process redundant and dispensable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> This is good stuff! The impulses from the individual's sensory perception is filtered through a mechanism that is influenced by the current body and it's stored history of retained memories. This influences the experience bringing the mind into the picture as it tries to gain an understanding of the perception using the history it has cataloged.</p>

<p> As long as your consciousness is plagued by the breath and the senses it cannot perform its proper function and is dominated by the mind. The breath gives life to the ego which is your thoughts on your life situation, a time based reality. Your mind then spends a good deal of time in the past and future, neither of which you are interested in. As long as the consciousness is plagued by senses, your mind is focused on body awareness that makes you believe you are a separate individual. The breath and the senses block your consciousness from it's most important job which is to tap into God consciousness and the all knowingness that it provides.</p>

<p> The goal is to shut down everything that is causing us to think we are having an individual experience and to turn on our communication system to God consciousness. So when your kundalini is completely functional, you tap into universal knowledge and discard your experience as an individual, realizing you are one with all. The rewards from this knowingness are so much greater than anything that could be gained by experiencing life as an individual. And so you start working for the good of all humanity and realize that God is the doer, you are just experiencing his work through you. You gain complete understanding of the temporary nature of your body, a prison that is the cause of your consciousness' feelings of separateness. In this state, your former desires and discomforts are either washed away or become trivial to you in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p> This is why Satyananda writes that there are essentially two types of human beings: those who are on the pravritti path and those who are on the nivritti path. A man following the pravritti (outward) path looks away from bindu towards the outside world. He is almost entirely motivated by external events. This is the path of most people today and it leads away from self-knowledge and into bondage. The other path, the nivritti (reversed) path, is the spiritual path, the path of wisdom. On this path the individual begins to face the bindu, turning in towards the source of his being. This path leads to freedom. The path of evolution is the pravritti path of manifestation and extroversion. The path of involution leads back along the path that has produced your individual being. It leads back through the bindu to sahasrara. In fact, the whole purpose of yoga practice is to help direct your awareness along the involutionary path.</p>

<p> The books all say we are not the mind, we are consciousness. The consciousness has access to the universal truths through the ajna. The mind is suppose to be a tool of the consciousness. It's job is to tell the consciousness what is going on in the body. Somehow the mind has taken over the consciousness making us believe that the mind and body is all you are. You can intellectually believe that this is not true but until you actually shut down the mind, you cannot utilize the full resources of the consciousness and therefore this is not truth to you but merely beliefs. The contents of the mind is made up of current sensory perceptions and stored sensory perceptions.</p>

<p> When the mind is focused on the stored sensory perceptions, you focus on a time based reality. Your life is consumed by memories or a fantasy based future. I believe shutting down the breath takes care of the stored sensory perceptions or the time based reality. The next step is to shut down the current sensory perceptions or body awareness which gives us our present “reality”. I believe the ability to do that comes after the achievement of kechari stage II and so I can't speak intelligently about this. Most of the senses the body has, sight, hearing, smell and taste are near the tongue. I have read that a circuit is completed when the tongue enters the nasal pharynx. What does this allow us to do?</p>

<p> Second off I hope I don't offend but I feel people are throwing the term guru around loosely. This is from the book be here now by dr. richard alpert who transformed to hari dass baba. "At certain stages in the spiritual journey, there is a quickening of the spirit which is brought about through the grace of the guru. When you are at one of the stages where you need this catalyst, it will be forthcoming. There is really nothing you can do about gurus. It doesn't work that way. If you go looking for a guru and you are not ready to find one, you will not find what you are looking for. On the other hand when you are ready, the guru will be exactly where you are at the appropriate moment. All you can do it purify yourself of body and mind. Each stage of purification will make you sensitive to new levels of perception. Finally you arrive at a level where the guru is. Question: Does everyone have a guru? Answer: Yes, however, you may or may not meet your guru on the physical plane in this lifetime. It isn't necessary. Since the relation between a guru and disciple is not on the physical plane, the guru can act upon you from within yourself. YOu may meet him thhrough dreams or visions or merely sense his presence. However, it is only after much purification that you will honor these meetings rather than rejecting them in favor of the more gross manifestations. There have been many saints who realized enlightenment without ever meeting their guru in a physical manifestation. . So My point is not to offend that people are loosely using the term guru where the term teacher or guide should be used instead of guru.</p>

<p> I tapped into this site a few days ago:</p>

<p> http://solarhealing.com/home/</p>

<p> Here is another site with some videos of HRM:</p>

<p> http://www.in5d.com/sun-gazing.html</p>

<p> HRM performs Trataka on the sun during the first hour after sunrise or the last hour before sunset. His pineal gland has been measured at 2 ½ times the size of a normal person's and it normally shrinks with age. Apparently he was busted eating food at an Indian restaurant which doesn't help his credibility but doesn't discount everything he says.</p>

<p> Yogananda also talks about the sun – taken from page 416 of Yogananda's book The Second Coming of Christ:</p>

<p> The primary medicine of the future will be rays, the vibratory nature of which is more compatible with the molecular atomic nature of the human body. Healing rays can reach into the atomic disorder of cells in chronic diseases. There is also much healing energy in the sun's rays, though the harmful effects of overexposure must be avoided.</p>

<p> My current focus is to attain Kechari stage 2 and do exercises to open up my Ajna. Performing Trataka on the sun is far more powerful than doing it on a candle. I have been practicing Trataka on the sun for 5 days now. The first day I did three sets of 20 seconds on my balcony. I then realized that I need to be barefoot on the earth (sand, dirt or rocks) for this to be effective. Also it seems to be hazy with low level clouds at night that prevent sun gazing so I have to wake up at 5:40 in the morning to catch the sunrise. I have been doing a quick Jala Neti before walking down to a local park and standing in the sand. I have been doing 3 sets of 1 minute the first few days. Today (day 5) I did 1 set of 2 minutes and 2 sets of 1 minute (I know I'm doing this more than what is initially recommended). This is a very powerful exercise! I will continue to do this for the next few months building up to 1 set of 3 – 6 minutes straight.</p>

<p> Afterwards I've been going to Park Omar, a local park with a 4 kilometer par course, and slowly jogging the 4 kilometers. I've been running in kechari with my mouth completely closed for the entire jog. I don't know why I started doing this or what effect it is having on me but I like doing it. Also I've been putting a glass pitcher of distilled water (get off the fluoridated water people!) out on my balcony in the sun every morning and drinking it throughout the day. I have no idea of the benefits of this either – just following the advice of HRM.</p>

<p> From page 385 of Yogananda's The Second Coming of Christ:</p>

<p> When through the help of wise men, souls are transferred from the brine of material desires to the sweet waters of Bliss, they bring rejoicing to the august Giver of Life. God loves to see His sons consciously seek Him, and He is extremely pleased when one influences others to come unto Him. When a reformed Spirit-bound soul inspires another spiritual fugitive to return to God, that service to a fellow being is considered the highest human duty.*</p>

<p> *”Whosoever shall impart to My devotees the supreme secret knowledge, with utmost devotion to Me, shall without doubt come unto Me. Not any among men performs more priceless service to Me than he; in all the world there shall be none dearer to Me” - (God Talks With Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita – page 68 – also by Yogananda)</p>

<p> I will say it again – I cannot recommend Yogananda's The Second Coming of Christ enough. That said, I don't bother telling my experiences to people who are not interested. It is much more productive telling them to someone who is interested than trying to gain the interest of someone who is not. This reminds me of a sales slogan – it's easier to find someone who will say yes than trying to convince someone who says no to say yes. I believe some people don't walk the path because they believe some cherished thing they do is a sin and will have to give it up. I am not ready to give up all my sensual pleasures yet either but I know that the pleasure I receive from maya is nothing compared to what lays in store for me.</p>

<p> When Jesus said Repent, he didn't mean stop doing what you are doing, you are guilty of sin. He meant seeking pleasure in transitory things (maya) ultimately leads to dissatisfaction. The only way to find true happiness is to form a relationship with the divine.</p>

   <p>umunhum:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> You are born to sin! Of course you are, your consciousness was placed in a nonfunctional body. Unfortunately most people don't understand what sinning is. Sinning is perceiving the world with the limited 5 senses, the mind, ego and intellect. As long as you use the 5 senses to create the world you are experiencing, you are a sinner. When your Third eye is open, you will create an entirely different world. When Jesus looked upon the ocean through his opened Ajna, he saw vibrating energy. And since he himself was vibrating energy, he could walk upon it. When we look at the ocean, we see water and so the physical world our thoughts create would drown us if we attempted Jesus' feat with our unopened third eye.</p>

<blockquote><p> 93. Nobody is a sinner; no one is holy either; if the mind is put into the Kutastha, then, there is no sin; otherwise, if the mind is outward, there is sin; in other words, when the mind is not in the Kutastha, it is in sin.</p></blockquote>

<p> The various churches have contorted Jesus' teachings to make you believe you are a sinner if you desire sex, money and other things. And these are sins but only because they are worldly desires. You are not of this world and so no worldly thing has anything to offer you. Believing the world has something to offer you is the sin – or missing the mark as Eckhart Tolle says. You are apart from the Divine when the mind is supplying the consciousness with demands and information. Liberation from the mind is the purpose for our life here. The mind is a desire creating factory and gives you one desire after another and says we will be happy when we achieve or acquire this or that. This is nonsense. The world is made up of nothing more than various electricities that are interpreted in the body. If you eat the right food, have sex with the right pretty girl, acquire enough gold or whatever else your mind desires; your mind gives you some temporary pleasure and then it wants something else. Once you shut down the mind, your true nature unfolds which is unconditional love, peace and bliss. The mind is a miser giving out very little pleasure compared to the Divine. The mind enslaves us. It makes us think that we are the body and that our happiness comes from outside of ourselves. This is the false duality. The kingdom of heaven is within. We are always only experiencing our self.</p>

<p> Your mind will die with the body one day, you will not. The characteristics of your next mind or ego you receive will be similar to the one you have now as your mind is a combination of your history of electrical experiences (your built up karma ) and the family and culture you are born into. The goal is to kill the mind and become just presence before the body dies and takes the mind with it. You are not your karma, you are presence not experiences. That is your true nature, the mind makes you think that you are experiences or your life situation. The reason spiritual growth is the most important thing you can pursue is because it is the only thing you will take with you into your next life. Your progress takes place in the astral body which you take with you into your next incarnation. Any achievement made in the physical world dies with the body.</p>

<p> I definitely turned my Kundalini on from doing Satyananda's exercises. This is from the book Moola Banda – The Master Key Page 1 Paragraph 1:</p>

<blockquote><p> In the Yogataravali Sutras it is said: Jalandhara bandha, uddiyana bandha and moola bandha are situated in the throat, abdomen and perineum respectively. If their duration can be increased then where is the fear of death? By the practice of these three bandhas the dormant kundalini awakens and enters into the sushumna. The breath becomes still (kumbhaka). With the performance of these three bandhas the exhalation and inhalation ceases to function. With this the senses become purified and kevala (enlightenment) takes place. I pray for that knowledge residing in kevala kumbhaka.</p></blockquote>

<p> I was right about the breath being linked with the mind – from Ramana – Who Am I?:</p>

<blockquote><p> Are there no other means for making the mind quiescent?</p>

<p> Other than inquiry, there are no adequate means. If through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth. Through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions. The source is the same for both mind and breath. Thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought “I” is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent.</p></blockquote>

<p> I was describing my experiences. Every time my breath would stop, my mind would stop. I haven't transcended the senses. I made it to kechari stage 2 about the beginning of April. I didn't cut my frenulum at all in the months of December, January and the first few weeks of February. Finally I realized that I wasn't going to make it to stage 2 unless I started cutting again. This is from Kundalini Yoga by Sivananda:</p>

http://www.yoga-age.com/modern/kun1.html

<blockquote><p> The lower part of the front portion of the tongue, the frenum lingua, is cut to the extent of a hair’s breadth with a sharp knife once in a week. Afterwards powder of turmeric is dusted over it. This is continued for some months. This is Chhedan.</p>

<p> Afterwards the Yogic student applies butter to the tongue and lengthens it daily. He draws the tongue in such a way that it is similar to the process of milking the udder of a cow. This is Dohan.</p>

<p> When the tongue is sufficiently long (it should touch the tip of the nose) the student folds it, takes it back and closes the posterior portion of the nostrils. Now he sits and meditates. The breath stops completely.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stage 2 was awkward at first. My tongue kept popping out. I could only keep it in the pharynx for about 30 seconds. It took about 2 weeks before I could hold it for a minute. Doing pranayama it would always fall out whenever I would lockout into maha bandha. Finally I got tired of pussyfooting it around and just started shoving my tongue up there. This was about the first week of May. And now I realize it is liking breaking in a virgin. I did the worst possible thing you could do, soft and slow and just prolonged the discomfort. You just have to start pushing your tongue up as far as you can. When you get to the later stages the base of your tongue is going to be where the tip of it is now and so the pharynx is going to stretch out a lot further. Not only that but it took me about 6 weeks to find my clitoris. At first I would get a feeling like when you put your tongue on a 9 volt battery. Just a little tingle. I thought is that it? I guess it's going to get progressively more sensitive. But my tongue would fall out after 20 seconds or so and that was it. Clunky is a good word for it that the AYPsite uses aptly. Then I read that you are suppose to push the pharynx forward and that exposes the secret spot.<p>

<p>It's just like when your press your hand on a woman's pubic bone pushing her skin up exposes her secret spot! And so rubbing your tongue back and forth at the top of your nasal septum creates a tingling feeling that sometimes feels buzzy and trippy. It draws your attention inward. I haven't got my tongue across the whole thing yet so I don't know if I'm experiencing everything there is yet. And I don't think I am. One thing I found is that the reason your nasal passage gets blocked up is a flap of skin covers the top part of your passage. It is the trippiest thing. And the flap of skin switches with your nadis every 90 minutes to 2 hours. I can stick my tongue down the nasal passage way to feel which part of my brain is dominant right now by feeling which nostril has the flap covering it. They say you are suppose to meditate when the right brain is dominant or the left nostril is open. I can't do internal nadi shodhana yet because I can't reach the top of my nasal hole to block it with my tongue yet.</p>

<p>I've had several experiences when meditating where my back felt like the trunk of a tree. While rubbing the secret spot and sitting breathless in shambhavi mudra suddenly my back would raise up straightening out and then feel like it was made out of stone. I just started practicing an entire yoga asana session with my tongue rubbing my secret spot and try to spend several hours a day with my tongue resting there.</p>

<p>The next goal is to figure out how to shut off the senses so that I can get to the first level of Samadhi. I read that the weight of the tongue on the nasal pharynx pulls on part of the brain and pinches off the circuit where the nerve signals travel from the sensory organs to the mind to decipher what is going on. I also read that you have to push on this circuit with the tongue and that cuts off the sensory perception signals from reaching the mind. The latter sounds more realistic but I don't know where to push or if my tongue is long enough. I need to get more diligent about tongue stretching exercises. I don't know if I milk correctly. How many times or how long should I milk my tongue?</p>

<p>With my kundalini on and my Muladhara open the next chakra I need to focus on is Svadhishthana. Satyananda's Tantra book has basically only two exercises for the sex chakra - ashwini and vajroli mudras. So I put this song on and just have a ball fooling around with ashwini and vajroli mudras:</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTgU4l0dnGU</p>

<p>No instruction needed, just go with whatever rhythm you like. The asanas to open the sex chakra are cobra, triangle, twists, locust, bow, and camel.</p>

<p>Next is the Manipura Chakra and I've read that mastering nauli is the key opening that. And after that Shakti Chalana is the method to pull the kundalini up the sushumna:</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWNKkdTNBwE</p>

<p>Notice how she locks out her stomach in uddiyana bandha.</p>

<p>Once the kundalini makes it to the Anahata it rarely descends. Of course I'm just spouting out book knowledge. Even though I don't know what I'm doing, I still feel like I'm being guided. I gave up on my sun gazing. I did it for 5 months and got up to 30 minutes but then the sun shifted and I could no longer watch it come out of the ocean from my balcony. I bought a earthing mat so that I would be grounded. Now I have to drive 30 minutes from my house and on days when there are clouds it is a real bummer. And you never know if there are going to be clouds until the sun is just about to rise. In returning home I would hit the morning commute and the traffic was terrible. When the sunrise shifts back to where I can watch it from my balcony, I will practice trataka on it again.</p>

<p>I knew that I wasn't the only schmo ever to combine Kriya 6 and Kriya 7 together and so when I found this I freaked and immediately adopted it as my Sadhana. Of course I had to tweak it here and there:</p>

<a href="https://goldenagejourney.blogspot.com/2012/03/golden-age-kriya-en-kriya.html">http://goldenagejourney.blogspot.com...-en-kriya.html</a>

<p>This is a pretty intense sadhana. I wake up every morning at 4:30 for brahmamahurta, do my toilet duties, scrap my tongue with a tongue scraper (you must buy one of these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Tungs-Products-Stainless-Cleaner/dp/B00064JGBO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370435604&sr=8-1&keywords=tongue+scraper">http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Tungs-Produ...tongue+scraper</a> ), brush my teeth, practice amaroli, jala neti, roll around on my yoga ball in wheel pose for 5 minutes. Do headstand and several variations of it for 5 minutes then pranayama:</p>

<p>1. First I do 11 rounds of nadi shodhana, anoloma veloma or alternate nostril breathing which ever you call it. The first 4 rounds I do maha bandha and while holding the exhale do 20 bastrika stomach pumps and then while holding the inhale jalahandra dynamic chin pumps with 5 circles. The next 4 rounds exhale the same, inhale chaturtha pranayama (which is just going through your chakras breaking the tissue paper that I mentally create for each chakra on the way down and then back up). Then the last three rounds just like the first four – exhale into maha bandha then do 20 bastrika stomach pumps and inhale into dynamic jalahandra with 5 circles of the head.</p>

<p>2. I then do 100 Breath of Fire with the last one exhaling right into Kriya 7</p>
<p>3. I then do 12 rounds of exhaling into Kriya 7 and inhaling into Kriya 6. This is the Sham – Kech – Moo to Nas - Udd – Moo I wrote about months ago. I do 8 cycles of chakra rotation before inhaling or exhaling.</p>
<p>4. I then exhale into maha bandha and perform 20 bastrika stomach pumps with the breath outside then inhale into Kriya 10 for two rounds, back to maha bandha on the exhale and some bastrikas. Then the next two rounds I do Kriya 11 theses are in Kundalini Tantra and also listed on Manoj's video. I do a total of 12 Shamukhi mudra breaths doing these alternating kriyas – 6 of each. For Kriya 10 I like to rest my tongue on my septum and squeeze off 20 moos feeling the current go up. For Kriya 11 I'm not big on the green snake. I just do 3 – 4 circles touching my chakras down awarohan and then up the arohan.</p>
<p>5. 14 internal Om's – mouth is closed, kechari sealed off throat, humm Om on the exhale and imagine the breath is exhaling out of my Anahata Chakra.</p>
<p>6. The lords prayer, 5 Jesus prayer, salutations to Yogananda, Yukteshwar, Lahiri, Babaji, Ennio, and Norm Paulsen, salutations to Satyananda, Sivananda, Babaji, My Yoga teacher, Manoj, and Nithyananda, Salutations to my mother, father, brother, sister, relatives, friends, lovers, teachers, fellow students, all the people of the world, Repeat all the salutations</p>
<p>7. I chant Satyananda's chant 3 times:</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Je858eqwUw</p>


<p>Jalahandra Chin Pump:</p>

<p>http://www.aypsite.org/139.html</p>

<p>Kriya 6 and 7 can be found on manoj's site or doing a search for Kundalini Tantra pdf on any search engine - Satyananda puts it out for free.</p>

<p>A question posed to me was how do you feel the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th chakra?</p>

<p>It is easy to feel the 2nd chakra. You just squeeze the muscle you use to cut off your urine. You should be separating your orgasms from ejaculation. This is another way to build chakra awareness there. As I stated in an earlier post, Yogananda says that sex holds back most men from spiritual growth. Do not let the creative power of the universe needlessly escape out of your body. Don't spill your seed! This energy is reabsorbed into the body, combines with prana and clears out your sushumna. I have read that it takes the body 2 weeks to a month to replenish the sperm lost in one ejaculation. Do an internet search on Brahmacharya and Sivananda if you want to know how important this is. Sivananda is a bit too hardcore with Brahmacharya for me, I like Satyananda's approach better. Have all the sex you want but you must learn to separate your orgasms from ejaculation. When I first started practicing this I felt a soreness in my penis. This went away after a week or two. I think it was from using muscles that I never used before. The teachings of Babaji Mantra linked above is a great exercise to build awareness. Listen to that and practice Vajroli Mudra.</p>

<p>The 3rd chakra is also easy to feel. You should be practicing Maha Bandha every sadhana. Maha Bandha consists of Jalahandra Bandha, Uddiyana Bandha and Mula Bandha. Uddiyana Bandha should build chakra awareness in your stomach. If it doesn't (and I don't know how that is possible) then you should practice bastrika with the air exhaled. This will make your stomach sore for a few days when you first do it. I do 20 pumps 34 times (22 in exercise 1 and 12 in exercise 4) in my morning sadhana for a total of 680 bastrika pumps every morning. My stomach has ripples all the way through it. I still haven't mastered nauli. That is something that I want to learn this year.</p>

<p>Maha bandha, sitting and Siddhasana, and kechari with the throat sealed off is one way to turn on your kundalini. So Maha bandha is extremely important. While sitting in Siddhasana I turn my hands so my thumbs are on the outside of my thighs and my fingers are on the inside and straighten out my arms using them as a brace to squeeze everything I can out of my diaphragm when I go into Uddiyana. First you exhale everything you've got in your lungs then you pull your stomach in then up. You should feel a locking out of your stomach. ***note*** This is extremely important – you should feel a locking out of your stomach and then do some bastrikas to really build awareness. On the inhale I will open up my arms laying my arms back on my legs with the palms facing upwards. Hopefully you understand what I'm doing with this description. You can Inhale and exhale in and out of Maha bandha doing a quick 5 reps and then do 5 slow ones holding the breath as long as you can. Point being practice Maha bandha as much as you can. I do my morning sadhana the same every morning and just play around with various exercises at night.</p>

<p>The 4th Chakra is a bit harder. I always think of a lover and kind of push my chest out. When I first started listening to Eckhart Tolle and my first reading of the Bhagavad Gita made my chest swell and feel so good and that it built a lot of awareness there for me. One of my favorite things to do is Meditate in the breathless state and do Cartartha Pranayama up and down my chakras. I like listening to this Mantra:</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w02fzNLB6_s</p>

<p>Om Na Ma Ha Shi Va up the chakras with Va in Ajna and then the air rushes out the crown and start back at Muladhara with Om. When I first started doing this I couldn't keep up with the mantra until instead of going up with the syllables, I would go in and out. So you start with the air going in with your anus with Om, your out with your sex with Na, your in with your stomach with Ma, your out with your chest with Ha, your in with you tongue with Shi and out with you Ajna with Va and then slip out your crown. Hopefully you understand what I mean. The in out in out in out of doing this almost makes you think of your kundalini as a snake. Hmmm, where have we heard that metaphor before?</p>

<p>Another question was how long and what did I practice before my awakening. I practice a fairly advanced form of Sivananda Yoga 3 times a week and light floor exercise the other days for about 5 years and only practiced various pranayama exercises for about 7 weeks before my kundalini turned on. The only pranayama I practiced before the 7 week stint was 2 rounds of Breath of fire about 150 exhales per round before yoga and I would always sit with my breath held after a round waiting for my body to tell me it is time to breathe again. As I think Avatar stated, breath of fire decarbonizes the blood and so you shouldn't have to breathe for about a minute or so after a round. Another aspect that I think contributed to my awakening was I felt very grateful during that time period. I remember also reading Norm Paulsen's book and him saying you must demand from the divine that you want to know who and what you are. That you want a relationship with the divine. You have a right to know the truth about yourself and your creator. No more games – I will make the effort but I want to know the truth about what I am.</p>

<p>I got my current reading list from David Hawkins.</p>

<a href="https://happy-firewalker.blogspot.com/2010/03/dr-david-hawkins-reading-list.html">http://happy-firewalker.blogspot.com...ding-list.html</a>

<p>I listen to his videos on youtube and had to buy A Course in Miracles on his recommendation. I am currently on day 33 in the book.</p>

<p>I highly recommend listening to videos on youtube by David Hawkins. His video on stress, aging, the ego and many others are all priceless. Here's one on sex:</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6ewYe2zO60</p>

<p>Currently I'm reading Play of Consciousness by Muktananda. You pick up tips from reading books of masters. I learned that you must surrender to the fact that your body is not yours and it is necessary to sit in full lotus for 3 hours to purify all 2 million of your nadis, among many other things so far from this one. I still have problems with my knees but sit every morning in Siddhasana for 90 minutes of pranayama.</p>

   <p>umunhum:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I see you were a devoted yoga practitioner before you got Satyananda's book Kundalini Tantra. I'm starting from scratch but reading your story, spiritual growth sound reachable following a couple of Satyananda's books. I know a guru is always required, but when there's none around, should we just lay down and die? I Don't think so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lahiri agrees with you:</p>

<p>#106. Do not be idle. Practice Kriya. Do not wait for advice to practice Kriya.</p>
<p>#107. Exhaust your breath in practicing Kriya. Eventually breath will be Sthira, Tranquil.</p>

<p>There are so many gems in Lahiri's 108 pieces of advice. I've read that it takes thousands of lifetimes to achieve enlightenment. And the thoughts that follow that for me say I'm not good enough. I'm a heathen. I'm a sinner. There is no way that I can make it then. But that's just nonsense from the mind. An Eckhart Tolle quote that haunts me is “Most Buddhists believe enlightenment is only for the Buddha. Yet Buddha said it is a rare gift to be born a human, a rarer gift still to hear of enlightenment, and an even rarer gift to try to achieve it. Jesus said the servant shall equal the master. This is our destiny. We will all achieve it! So why not this lifetime? And what do we have to lose? Our states of bliss are only going to increase in intensity as we travel down the path.</p>

<p>I want to get to the first stage of samadhi. I've read that you push on something with your tongue and it compresses part of the brain blocking the nerve signals from getting through. This gets you past the subtle body into the void between the unmanifested and the manifested. I have a friend who actually believes everything I say and is now practicing too. He recently made kechari stage 2 as well and says that we might have to push on a bone at the back of the upper throat area and the other side of the bone might compress the signals. He said he gets tingly feelings when he pushes on the bone in the back part of his throat. I've spent all my time playing around with my secret spot in the front and so need to explore a bit more.</p>

<p>I wonder if the purpose of the head circles and movements are to cause the tongue to put pressure in certain areas inside the nasal cavity? Lahiri would do a similar exercise like the dynamic Jalahandra chin pump called Omkar Kriya by Ennio. He would strike the heart chakra jerking his head down several times. I wonder what is going on with his kechari during this exercise?</p>

<p>I noticed that my frenulum was hard a few days ago. It is like it is scabbed up from the inside. And I don't think this was caused from cuts with a razor. I started thinking about what could be causing this and the thought occurred to me that the electricity flowing through my tongue burnt it. I just started being able to hold kechari 2 for hours and in my pranayama session in the morning the last week or so. The skin that makes up the frenulum can't take the voltage? Seeking talked about how his frenulum disappeared into his tongue. I think the same thing is happening to me. My tongue goes straight up now and this just started happening. Before I was curling it back. Looking at it in the mirror, I've gotten over 90% of what I'm going to get by cutting the frenulum. I think the rest of the length I'm going to need is going to have to come from stretching exercises because my tongue is simply not long enough. I think my Vishuddha is now open.</p>

<p>I've been playing around with kechari 2 while having sex. There is some sort of connection between the top of your nasal septum and your sex. When I go past the point of no return, if I push on my nasal septum, the energy is transferred there. It is as though the orgasm is taking place there not at my sex. I just started doing this so I really don't know what I'm doing yet but there is definitely a connection going on here. I would really like to know how we are wired.</p>

<p>One thing that occurred to me was that the reason that I'm not completely breathless (My diaphragm is not moving but a subtle amount of air is moving in and out my nose) is not because I need anything from the outside, but because my body is not purified yet, I'm still producing carbon dioxide from the inside. I was relaxing in the bath tub and I slipped underwater for about a minute with my fingers plugging my nose. I started to feel the urge to breathe but when I came out of the water I just lowered my fingers away from my nose and stayed breathless. The thought struck me that the urge to breathe comes from the need to expel the carbon dioxide my body is still making. As the air in my lungs fills up with carbon dioxide it exceeds the level of CO2 outside my body thus starting a vacuum, as nature always seeks equilibrium.</p>

<p>As long as you eat, your body is going to produce carbon and this necessitates the action of the breath to get rid of it. This is another reason why the Amrit you get from kechari stage 4 is so important. It allows you the ability to go without food, eliminating the production of carbon from the body. This is why Jesus and others fasted for 40 days – they could then take their meditations a lot deeper by shutting down their digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems. You can't do this if you have food in your body.</p>
